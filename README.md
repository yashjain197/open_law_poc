# üìú OpenLaw Petition Signer (React + Vite)

A minimal, good-looking React app that:
1) logs into your OpenLaw workspace,
2) renders a **Petition** template as a form,
3) previews the agreement,
4) creates an OpenLaw **contract**, and
5) opens the hosted OpenLaw page to **sign**.

It also supports downloading the PDF and (optionally) checking status after signing.

---

## Features

- OpenLaw template execution via `Openlaw` (ESM build)
- Auto-generated form with **openlaw-elements**
- Contract creation via **APIClient.uploadContract**
- One-click ‚ÄúOpen in OpenLaw to sign‚Äù
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Absolute link generation to avoid `/undefined/contract/...` issues

- **npm** (or pnpm/yarn if you prefer)
